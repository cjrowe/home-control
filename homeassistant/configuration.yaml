# Discover some devices automatically
#### This component will try to automatically add 11 different uPnP devices.  This includes Chromecast, Wemo Switches, Hue Lights, Netgear routers, Plex, Viera, Roku, Sonos, Yamaha media player, Squeezebox, DirectTV
#### I have found this to work about 75% of the time, also this can be slow.  I recommend adding the components manually (We will add Sonos, Philips Hue in the next walk-through)
